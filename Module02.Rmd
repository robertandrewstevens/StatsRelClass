**Typical Six Sigma Phase:**  Measure

**Six Sigma Green Belt Body of Knowledge Subtopic:**

- Drawing valid statistical conclusions  

- Central limit theorem and sampling distribution of the mean  

- Basic probability concepts  

- Types of data and measurement scales  

- Data collection methods  

- Techniques for assuring data accuracy and integrity  

- Probability distributions  

- Descriptive statistics

**Six Sigma Green Belt Body of Knowledge Description:**

- Distinguish between enumerative (descriptive) and analytical (inferential) studies, and distinguish between a population parameter and a sample statistic.

- Define the central limit theorem and describe its significance in the application of inferential statistics for confidence intervals, control charts, etc.

- Describe and apply concepts such as independence, mutually exclusive, multiplication rules, etc.

- Identify and classify continuous (variables) and discrete (attributes) data. 

- Describe and define nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio measurement scales.

- Define and apply methods for collecting data such as check sheets, coded data, etc.

- Define and apply techniques such as random sampling, stratified sampling, sample homogeneity, etc.

- Describe and interpret normal, binomial, and Poisson, chi square, Student’s t, and F distributions.

- Define, compute, and interpret measures of dispersion and central tendency, and construct and interpret frequency distributions and cumulative frequency distributions.

## Problems:

Read “What You Need to Know about Probability” from Practical Statistical Tools for the Reliability Engineer, pages 1-6.

**Exercise 2-1:**  Analyze Belt Life data located in “Module02 Basic Statistics.xls” tab “Belt A” in Statistica.  Calculate the Mean, Median, Standard Deviation, Variance, Range

**Exercise 2-2:**  The data in “Module02 Basic Statistics.xls” tab “TAB4-1” contain the weights of 10 silicon wafers measured by 3 operators.  Which wafers have the highest average weight and which have the highest measurement variation?  Which operators have the highest average weight readings and which have the highest measurement variation?

**Exercise 2-3:**  The data in “Module02 Basic Statistics.xls” tab “APP7-A” contain oxide etch rates for 27 production runs, 6 wafers/run, 9 sites/wafer.  Identify which runs, wafers, and sites have the highest and lowest average values and variability?

**Exercise 2-4:**  A transformer (not the toy) has a Normal time to failure distribution with mean of 6250 hours and standard deviation of 2600 hours and its warranty period is 4000 hours.

- What is the proportion of failures at 4000 hours?

- What is the proportion of survivors at 4000 hours, i.e., its reliability?

**Exercise 2-5:**  In reliability, it’s problematic to have failures occurring at times less than or equal to 0.  For the information in Exercise 2-4, calculate the fraction of failures that is theoretically possible at or below time = 0.
